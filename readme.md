## About my project last week

### What I succeded in this project:
1. I got three cards modal whose contents are changing accordingly to the cards' contents.
2. I got the ingredients and stpes vaue as well by looping through the them.
3. I got form modal by using event delegation for the new button in the outer nodal.

### Code requirements

I think some of them meet the requirement but some of them don't.

### Improvement that I wish to make with my code

If I had more time, I would make my code more understandable and neater by putting more comments and using all of the cool methods. I didn't access the form' s value fully in the last modal so I want to do that.
